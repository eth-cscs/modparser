Write the lexer
    - support for block comments
    - ability to parse VERBATIM blocks
        - VERBATIM is a major code stink
        - ... so do a review of all use cases for VERBATIM and generalize them
          into the DSL
    - elegant handling of errors in the lexer
        + implemented
        - need some unit tests

write the Parser
    - design the AST structure
        - I don't know what the root node looks like...
