I added the external dependency with:

> git submodule add git@github.com:bcumming/vector.git lib/vector

When a new checkout of this repository is performed, the user has to manually
set up the external dependency

> git submodule init
> git submodule update

If there are updates in the external dependency that you want to pull in, you
have to change path:

> cd lib/vector
> git pull
