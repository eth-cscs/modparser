--------------------------------
threadsafe
--------------------------------

currently users have to specify that the module is thread safe, by adding the
THREADSAFE keyword to the NEURON block.

In some .mod files I see comments like "no idea if this is threadsafe, doing
this so that bluron works"

Instead of leaving this up to users this should be determined by analysis.

To understand:
    - what does threadsafe mean in this context?
    - do we even need it, if we ensure that the generated code is threadsafe?
