User story for sprint 17.11.2014 -- 03.12.2014

I will be at SC14 for the first week.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I want to be able to parse a simple .mod file from CoreNeuron. This will require
a lexer and parser for the .mod files.

In the medium term I want to use the parsed information to generate different
implementations of the kernel to test the impact of data layouts (AoS, SoA, AoSoA)

But for this sprint I will focus on parsing the files well-enough to generate
some simple information about computational complexity.

Success Criteria
b) Parse a simple .mod file with no errors
    - no VERBATIM blocks
c) Generate AST for PROCEDURE, INITIAL, DERIVATIVE blocks
c) Generate information about the computational complexity of a kernel
    - number of floating point ops  (+,*,/,exp,^)
    - number of loads and stores

Requirements
a) a mod file that has only the basic features I want to parse: KdShu2007.mod
