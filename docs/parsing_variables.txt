- special PARAMETER variables, like v and celcius, have
local ghost storage that is to be loaded
    - this might be a vector that has to be gathered for v
    - might be a scalar, like celcius, which would have to
      be copied to the device memory on GPU


add STATE variables
    - range
    - readwrite
    - local linkage

add PARAMETER variables
    // deal with 'special' variables that are imported from Neuron
    if(v)
        - range
        - read
        - global linkage // actually local linkage, loaded from global storage 
    else if(celcius)
        - scalar
        - read
        - global linkage
    // ...
    // local parameters, which are set to scalar by default
    // but can be changed to range when the RANGE statement
    // is parsed in the NEURON block
    else
        - scalar
        - read
        - local linkage

add ASSIGNED variables
    // the local linkage can be modified later if the
    // variable is in the GLOBAL statement in the NEURON block
    - range
    - readwrite
    - local linkage

  USEION k WRITE ik
  RANGE  gkbar, ik, ek
  GLOBAL minf, mtau, hinf, htau

parse NEURON block
    for ion in USEION
        update or create ion variable in lookup
    for var in RANGE
        update var in loopup
    for var in GLOBAL
        update var in lookup
