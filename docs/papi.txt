Support for papi is provided via the papi-wrap library.

You first have to build papi-wrap, which is in external/papi-wrap

set PAPI_ROOT

export PAPI_ROOT=/opt/cray/papi/5.3.2/
cd external/papi-wrap
ccmake .
# use g++


# you have to build papi, because the version on cray is polluted with CUDA shit
# note: this probably isn't the case on Dora
wget http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projects/papi/downloads/papi-5.4.0.tar.gz

export CC=`which gcc`
export CXX=`which g++`
./configure --prefix=/scratch/daint/bcumming/libs/papi

oh well, for some reason my build of papi fails spectacularly
